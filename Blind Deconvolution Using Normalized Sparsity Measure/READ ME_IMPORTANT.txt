-Here, "test_blind_deconv.m" is the main code. Please run the code and it will ask you to input the blurred image.
 Sample image files used in this paper are given in "Test Images" folder.
 The author of the paper has changed the kernel for different images for a better output. 
 So, to change the kernel size, please do to line-58 (of "test_blind_deconv.m") 
 and change the value of "opts.kernel_size".

-"ms_blind_deconv.m" and "ss_blind_deconv.m" functions are used for multi-scale and single-scale deconvolution 
  operation.

-"center_kernel_separate.m", "fast_deconv_bregman.m", "pcg_kernel_core_irls_conv.m", "pcg_kernel_irls_conv.m"
  "solve_image_bregman.m", and "test_blind_deconv_params.m" functions are used for setting the parameters for 
   the main function, normalization using ISTA, and Kernel generation using IRLS algorithm.
